This POC application has a few goals, it's sorta RESTful and uses sinatra to interact with prospero messaging system.
	1. Provides a listener endpoint that will return the form post variables.
	2. Easy way to subscribe and unsubscribe to messages.
	3. Eventually tie into a UI client so we can easily 'tap' into messages coming from prospero, allowing us to easily test.
